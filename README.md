## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**GlauberMC/GlauberMC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Java and Python to Data Science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques and data visualization.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects or any open-source initiatives.
- ðŸ¤”  Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing algorithms and best practices in data science.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science workflows, Python libraries, or Java applications!
